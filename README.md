Inventor Tony Stark applies his genius for high-tech solutions to problems as Iron Man, the armored Avenger.

At the very core of the Iron Man technology lies the Arc Reactor.augmented and strengthened by Tony Stark, the Reactor provides a clean, manageable energy source with incredible output, one that can be adapted to most anything. At first a large piece of equipment, the younger Stark miniaturized the technology into the “RT,” which was the size of a human heart, and put it to great use to power his suits of armor.Iron Man’s armor provided a complete working environment for its user, including enhanced strength, closed air systems, data input, communications, flight, defense systems, and offensive weaponry such as missiles, lasers, and so-called “repulsor” technology. 

Stark never stops in his advancement of his armor designs, and at one time created multiple versions, each one of them with a specialized use. The armor has also become lighter and more flexible since the first incarnation, allowing Stark to “suit up” in mere seconds and be immediately ready for action.

 Perseverance. Tony doesn't give up. He built a flying suit of armor using scrapes in a cave, he synthesized a new element when he was on the verge of death, he went head-to-head with a super soldier with nothing but a gauntlet/watch device.
